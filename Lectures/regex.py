. 	Any character (except newline character) 	"he..o" 	
^ 	Starts with 	"^hello" 	
$ 	Ends with 	"planet$" 	
* 	Zero or more occurrences 	"he.*o" 	
+ 	One or more occurrences 	"he.+o" 	
? 	Zero or one occurrences 	"he.?o" 	
{} 	Exactly the specified number of occurrences 	"he.{2}o" 	
| 	Either or 	"falls|stays" 	
() 	Capture and group
\d	Any digit	[0-9]
\D	Any non-digit	[^0-9]
